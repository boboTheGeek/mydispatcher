Language       :  C language
Platform       :  Ubuntu Linux

Files Included : 
             sourcecode:
                 mydispatcher.c 
                 mydispatcher.h 
                 algFCFS.c
                 algRR.c
                 algSRT.c
                 algSTN.c
                 libQmgr.c
                 libstats.c
                 
             other:
                 readme
                 documentation
		 makefile

How to Compile:  
Type the following in the terminal and press ENTER
    
    make   

or, if makefile is not working

    gcc -o mydispatcher mydispatcher.c algFCFS.c algRR.c algSTN.c algSRT.c libstats.c libQmgr.c
		
after typing either of those script, press enter and the code will be compiled

How to Run:  
Type the following in the terminal and press ENTER

    ./mydispatcher input.dat <algorithm>

	where <algorithm> is either "FCFS", "RR", "STN", "SRT"

Known Bugs:  

   - Hangs in scenario when process queue is empty but not all processes are complete

==================================

This project is to implement the CPU scheduling policies, First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Round-Robin (RR), Shortest Process Next (SPN) and Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) described in the textbook.
